* What is Assertion ?
==> An assertion is a statement that checks whether a certain condition is true. In the context of programming, assertions help you express assumptions about your code. They provide a way to verify that your expectations hold true during the execution of your program.
    Assertions play a crucial role in testing and debugging. They help you catch unexpected behavior early in the development process, making it easier to identify and fix issues before they reach production.
    It return nothing when it gets success otherwise it returns Assertion error.

* Why are Assertions Important?
==> Catch Bugs Early:- Assertions help you catch errors and bugs as soon as they occur, making it easier to identify and fix problems during development rather than after your code has been deployed.
==> Validate Inputs and Outputs:- Assertions can be used to validate input parameters, function return values, or any other aspect of your code's behavior.
==> Debugging: When an assertion fails, it provides you with valuable information about where and why something went wrong. This can significantly speed up the debugging process.
==> Refactoring Safety: When you refactor or modify code, assertions serve as a safety net that alerts you if the changes break your code's expected behavior.
